```
type C:\Users\alin\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@192.168.128.225 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

```
### 3. Set the permissions for ssh key file
On local Windows computer:
```
right-click on 'id_rsa.pub' > Properties > Security > Advanced > Add
click on 'Select a principal'
write your username, then click on 'Check Names'
click on the username, then click OK, OK, Apply, OK, OK
```

### 4. Connect automaticaly to remote 
```
ssh pi@192.168.128.225 -i C:\Users\Alin/.ssh/id_rsa
```


### 5 Disable existing enabled site
